        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Royal Oud Essence was founded with a passion for preserving the ancient art of oud perfumery. We blend
            tradition with modern sophistication to create world-class fragrances.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to deliver authentic, long-lasting scents that reflect elegance and prestige.
            Oud is typically used as a base note due to its longevity and ability to anchor and enhance other fragrance
            components. It pairs well with florals, spices, and other woods, adding complexity, warmth, and a sense of
            luxury to perfumes and home scents. Its intense, powerful character makes it ideal for evening wear, cooler
            seasons, and sophisticated settings.In summary, oud is a luxury fragrance ingredient prized for its deep,
            rich, and evolving aromatic profile, blending earthy, woody, smoky, sweet, and animalic nuances into a
            lavish and enigmatic scent experience that has captivated cultures for centuries</p>
