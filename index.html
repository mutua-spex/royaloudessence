		<h2>Welcome to Royal Oud Essence</h2>
		<p>We specialize in premium oud perfumes sourced from the finest natural ingredients. Our scents are designed to
			leave a lasting impression.

			Oud, extracted from the resinous heartwood of Aquilaria trees, presents a dark and multifaceted aroma that
			evolves over time. Its scent is intensely woody and warm, often described as earthy, smoky, and profoundly
			resinous. Many users detect animalic undertones, giving it a primal and slightly musky character that can
			range from bold to subtle depending on the origin and processing method.When freshly applied, natural oud
			can have a harsh, medicinal, or damp forest-like quality, reminiscent of leather, balsamic resins, or wet
			woods. With maturation and blending in perfumes, it develops sweet and smooth undertones, including hints of
			tobacco, dark chocolate, amber, or honey, which balance its initial intensity for a refined and elegant
			finish</p>
